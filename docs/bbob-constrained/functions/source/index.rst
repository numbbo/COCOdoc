The ``bbob-constrained`` test suite contains 48 constrained functions in continuous domain which are derived from combining functions of the well-known single-objective noiseless ``bbob`` test suite with randomly-generated linear constraints perturbed by nonlinear transformations. This document aims to define those constrained functions as well as the approach used to build the constraints. It also describes how instances, targets and runtime are considered in the constrained case.

Introduction
============
We consider constrained optimization problems of the form

.. math:: 
   :nowrap:
   :label: cons_prob

   \begin{eqnarray*}
   \begin{array}{rcl}
   \displaystyle\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} & f(x) & \\
          \textrm{s.t.:} & g_i(x) \leq 0, & i = 1, \ldots, l,\\
   \end{array}
   \end{eqnarray*}

where :math:`n` is the number of variables of the problem (also called the problem dimension), :math:`f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}` is the objective function, and :math:`g_i: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`, :math:`i = 1, \ldots, l`, are the constraint functions, which are the result of nonlinear transformations applied to linear constraints :math:`h_i(x) = a_i^T x`, with :math:`a_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n}`. 

A point :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}^n` is said to be a *feasible solution* if :math:`g_i(x) \leq 0` for all :math:`i`. The set of all feasible solutions is called the *feasible set*, denoted here by :math:`\cal X`. An *optimal solution* is a point :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}} \in \cal X` such that :math:`f(x^{\textrm{opt}}) \leq f(x)` for all :math:`x \in \cal X`. We also make distinction between *global optimal solution* and *local optimal solution*. The latter is a point :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}} \in \cal X` such that :math:`f(x^{\textrm{opt}}) \leq f(x)` for all :math:`x \in \cal N \cap \cal X`, where :math:`\cal N` is a neighborhood of :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}}`, while the former considers the entire set :math:`\cal X` in the definition. In this documentation, we always refer the term "optimal solution" to "global optimal solution" and vice-versa. The latter term is used in contexts where local optimal solutions are also in discussion.

A point :math:`x^{\textrm{uopt}} \in \mathbb{R}^n` is said to be an *unconstrained optimal solution* to :eq:`cons_prob` if :math:`f(x^{\textrm{uopt}}) \leq f(x)` for all :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}^n`. Note that this definition does not require :math:`x^{\textrm{uopt}}` to be feasible. In other words, the constraints :math:`g_i` of the problem are not been considered in the definition. Depending on the context, we might call an optimal solution a constrained optimal solution in order to avoid ambiguity. By using the definitions of global and local optimal solutions given before, we go a step further to define *unconstrained global optimal solutions* and *unconstrained local optimal solutions*, where the constraints are not considered, as well as *constrained global optimal solutions* and *constrained local optimal solutions*, where the constraints are taken into account.

Before delving into detail about how the constrained problems are built, we familiarize the reader with some terms that are used in the Coco_ framework and, in particular, in this suite.

Terminology
-----------

*Objective function* or, simply, *function*
  An objective function :math:`f`, also referred to as function in Coco_, is a parametrized mapping :math:`\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}` with scalable input space, :math:`n\ge2`. Functions are parametrized such that different *instances* of the "same" function are available, e.g. translated or shifted versions. 

*Constraint*
  A constraint function :math:`g_i` is a parametrized mapping :math:`\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}` with scalable input space, :math:`n\ge2`. Constraints are also parametrized such that different *instances* of the "same" constraint are available, e.g. translated or rotated versions. In the next section, we give more details on the parameters of a constraint and how they are used to define the instances.

*Constrained function*
  A *constrained function* is a function :math:`f(x)` subject to constraints :math:`g_i(x)\leq 0`, :math:`i=1,\ldots,l`. For example, in :eq:`cons_prob`, we are minimizing a constrained function. Constrained functions are parametrized such that different *instances* of the "same" constrained function are available. In the next section, we describe how the idea of instance is employed in the constrained case.
  
*Runtime*
  We define *runtime*, or *run-length* as the *number of evaluations* conducted on a given problem until a prescribed target function value is
  hit, also referred to as the sum of the number of *objective function* evaluations and the number of *constraint* evaluations. We emphasize here that one single *constraint evaluation* in Coco_ is equivalent to one call to the routine that evaluates *all* the constraints at once, |coco_evaluate_constraint|_. Runtime is our central performance measure.

.. _subsec-instances-and-problems:

Instances and problems
----------------------

*constrained function instance*
  Each constrained function is parametrized by the (input) dimension, |n|, its identifier |i|, and the instance number, |j|.

  The parameter value |j| determines a so-called *constrained function instance*. This value is used in the ``bbob-constrained`` test suite to 

  (1) define an instance of the objective function,
  (2) define an instance of the constraints in the constrained function,
  (3) encode the location of the optimal solution of the constrained function.

  **IMPORTANT:** constrained functions with the same objective function but with different constraints are distinguished from each other and thus have different identifiers.

  A constraint :math:`g_k` in a constrained function :math:`f_i` is parametrized by the (input) dimension, |n|, the identifier of the constrained function, |i|, its identifier within the set of constraints, :math:`k\in\{1,\ldots,l\}`, and the instance number of the constrained function, |j|. The parametrized constrained function :math:`f_i` is then denoted by

  .. math::

    f(n, i, j)(x) \quad \textrm{subject to}\quad g(n, i, k, j)(x) \leq 0, \quad k = 1, \ldots, l.

  The parameters |i| and |j| are used in the seed formula given by :math:`\textrm{seed} = i + 20000 * j` to create an instance of the objective function. The value of :math:`\textrm{seed}` is used to define the unconstrained optimal solution, :math:`x^{\textrm{uopt}}`, and the unconstrained optimal value, :math:`f_{\textrm{uopt}}`, of the objective function through a random number generator. To create an instance of the constraints, we use the parameters |i|, |k| and |j| in the seed formula given by :math:`\textrm{seed} = i + 10000 * j + 50000 * k`. As we describe in Section :ref:`sec-overview-test-suite`, the constrained functions are built in a way such that the constrained optimal solution is initially at the origin. The whole constrained function (objective function + constraints) is then translated by a randomly-chosen vector so that the constrained optimal solution is moved away from the origin. The seed formula for generating this vector is given by :math:`\textrm{seed} = i + 10000 * j`.
    
  The rationale behind the use of parameter |k| is the following. Suppose that a constrained function is composed of the objective function and two (possibly perturbed) linear constraints :math:`g_1(x) = a_i^T x` and :math:`g_2(x) = a_2^T x`. The gradients :math:`a_1` and :math:`a_2` are randomly generated using the identifier of the constrained function, |i|, and the instance number, |j|, in the seed formula given above. However, using only these values for generating these vectors would result in identical gradients as the same seed would be used in the building process. By using also their identifiers, 1 and 2, we can generate different gradients, and, therefore, different constraints.

  Translations and rotations of linear constraints result in different linear constraints. Therefore, different instances of a constraint in the ``bbob-constrained`` test suite result in different constraints. 

  Each objective function is tested with 6 different numbers of constraints: :math:`1`, :math:`2`, :math:`6`, :math:`6 + \lfloor n/2 \rfloor`, :math:`6 + n` and :math:`6 + 3n`. Each composition results in a different constrained function with a different identifier |i|. Reasons for our choice of the number of constraints are that we have three dimension-independent numbers (:math:`1, 2, 6`) and three dimension-depending numbers (:math:`6 + \lfloor n/2 \rfloor`, :math:`6 + n` and :math:`6 + 3n`) without duplicates and increasing from small to large for all dimensions. Note that the number of dimension-depending constraints can also be written as :math:`6+\lfloor k\cdot n/2\rfloor` with :math:`k\in \{1,2,6\}`.
  
  .. One then may wonder what happens when :math:`n\leq 10`; for instance, when :math:`n=2`. In this case, there will be 6 constrained functions containing :math:`1`, :math:`2`, :math:`10`, :math:`n/2=1`, :math:`n-1=1` and :math:`n+1=3` constraints. This implies that 3 constrained functions will have the same objective funtion and the same number of constraints. However, since they have different identifiers |i|, which are used in the formula :math:`\textrm{seed} = i + 10000 * j + 50000 * k` to build the instances of the constraints, they have also different constraints.

*problem*
  We talk about a *problem*, |coco_problem_t|_, as a specific *constrained function instance* on which an optimization algorithm is run. A problem can be evaluated and returns an |f|-value or -vector and, in case, a |g|-vector. In the context of performance assessment, a target :math:`f`-value is added to define a problem. 

.. _subsec-raw-and-transformed-functions:

Raw functions and transformed functions
---------------------------------------

In the Coco_ framework, we call raw functions those functions without any linear or nonlinear transformation as opposed to a transformed function, which is a raw function where some transformation has been applied to. Functions from the ``bbob`` test suite are transformed functions. For example, the *raw sphere function* is given by

.. math::

  f(x) = \| x \|^2.

Its unconstrained optimal solution is at the origin and its unconstrained optimal value is zero. As it can be seen, neither linear nor nonlinear transformations have been applied to the function above. The transformed sphere function -- or simply, as it is called in the ``bbob`` suite, *sphere function* -- is defined as

.. math::

  f(x) = \|x-x^{\textrm{uopt}}\|^2 + f_{\textrm{uopt}},

where the vector :math:`x^{\textrm{uopt}}` and the scalar :math:`f_{\textrm{uopt}}` are constants whose values depend on the function identifier and instance number. These constants determine the unconstrained optimal solution and the unconstrained optimal function value of the problem, respectively.

Linear transformations, by definition, do not change some properties of the functions to which they are applied, such as symmetry. In order to make the functions less regular, Coco_ makes use of two nonlinear transformations, namely, :math:`T_{\textrm{asy}}^{\beta}` and :math:`T_{\textrm{osz}}` [HAN2009]_. The former is a symmetry breaking transformation while the latter introduces small, smooth but clearly visible irregularities. These nonlinear transformations can transform convex raw functions into nonconvex functions, for instance.

.. _sec-overview-test-suite:

Overview of the proposed ``bbob-constrained`` test suite
========================================================

The ``bbob-constrained`` test suite provides 48 constrained functions in six dimensions (2, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 40) with an arbitrary number of possible instances. The 48 functions are derived from combining 8 single-objective ``bbob`` functions with 6 different numbers of constraints: :math:`1`, :math:`2`, :math:`6`, :math:`6+\lfloor n/2\rfloor`, :math:`6 + n` and :math:`6+3n`. The constrained functions are built by picking up a ``bbob`` function satisfying some properties to be the objective function and building the constraints in a way such that we can keep control of the optimal solution. This process is explained in Subsection :ref:`subsec-defining-the-constrained-functions`.

While concrete details on each of the 48 ``bbob-constrained`` constrained functions are given in Section :ref:`sec-test-constrained-functions`, we will detail here the main rationale behind them together with their common properties.

.. _subsec-main-features:

Main features
-------------

We summarize below the main features of the constrained functions in the ``bbob-constrained`` test suite.

* Linear constraints perturbed by nonlinear transformations;
  
* Scalable with dimension;

* Non-trivial, with a few exceptions;
  
* Balanced with separable and non-separable functions;
  
* Known optimal function values;

* Uses functions from ``bbob`` as objective functions;

* Different number of constraints, three dimension independent and three dimension-dependent ones: :math:`1`, :math:`2`, :math:`6`, :math:`6+\lfloor n/2\rfloor`, :math:`6+n`, :math:`6+3n`;

* The constraints are randomly generated.

.. _subsec-how-cons-are-built:

How the constraints are built
-----------------------------

As we mentioned before, the constraints :math:`g_i` are linear constraints (possibly) perturbed by nonlinear transformations. These linear constraints are defined by their gradients :math:`a_i` which are randomly generated using a normal distribution. In order to ensure that the resulting feasible set contains points other than the origin, the following steps are considered in the generation process.
  
1) Sample :math:`l` vectors :math:`a_1`, :math:`a_2`, :math:`\ldots`, :math:`a_l`.

2) Choose a point :math:`p` that will be a feasible solution.

3) For each vector :math:`a_i` such that :math:`a_i^T p > 0`, redefine :math:`a_i = -a_i`.

4) Define the constraints :math:`g_i` using the vectors :math:`a_1`, :math:`a_2`, :math:`\ldots`, :math:`a_m`.

The algorithm above ensures a feasible half-line defined by :math:`\{\alpha p\,|\,\alpha\geq0\}`. The application of nonlinear transformations is detailed in Subsection :ref:`subsec-applying-nonlinear-transformations`.

.. _subsec-defining-the-constrained-functions:

Defining the constrained functions
----------------------------------

The constrained functions are defined in a way such that their optimal solutions are different from the optimal solutions of their unconstrained counterparts. The reason for this choice lies in the fact that if both optimal solutions were equal, the constraints would have no major impact on the difficulty of the problem in the sense that an algorithm for unconstrained optimization could be run and could obtain the optimal solution without considering any constraint.

Before describing how we define a point as an optimal solution to a constrained function, we introduce some conditions for a solution to be optimal called the *Karush-Kuhn-Tucker* conditions, or, simply, the KKT conditions. Such conditions are first-order necessary conditions for optimality given that the problem satisfies some regularity conditions. 

**The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions**

Suppose that the function :math:`f` and the constraints :math:`g_i` are continuously differentiable at a point :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}}` and that the problem satisfies some regularity conditions (for instance, the functions :math:`g_i` being affine). The KKT theorem (see, for instance, [BAZ2013]_) states that if :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}}` is a local optimal solution, then there exist constants :math:`\mu_i`, :math:`i=1,\ldots,l` called *Lagrange multipliers*, such that

.. math::
  
  \nabla f(x^{\textrm{opt}}) + \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i \nabla g_i(x^{\textrm{opt}}) = 0, 

  g_i(x^{\textrm{opt}}) \leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, l,

  \mu_i g_i(x^{\textrm{opt}}) = 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, l,

  \mu_i \geq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, l.

A point that satisfies the KKT conditions is called a *KKT point*. Note that a KKT point is not necessarily a local optimal solution. The KKT conditions may be sufficient for optimality if some additional conditions are satisfied; for instance, if the objective function and the constraints :math:`g_i` are convex and continuously differentiable over :math:`\R^n`. Furthermore, when convexity holds, the KKT point is also a global optimal solution. A more general result states that if the objective function is pseudoconvex and the constraints :math:`g_i` are quasiconvex, then the KKT conditions are sufficient for optimality and the KKT point is a global optimal solution [BAZ2013]_. 

**Generic algorithm for defining the constrained functions**

Initially, we choose the origin to be the optimal solution of the constrained functions. Then, we pick up a ``bbob`` function whose raw function is pseudoconvex to be the objective function and we build the linear constraints in such a way that the origin becomes a KKT point and also the optimal solution to the final constrained function. The first steps for constructing the constrained functions can be summarized in an algorithmic way as it follows. Assume for now that the chosen ``bbob`` function does not contain any nonlinear transformation in its definition.

1. Pick up a ``bbob`` function :math:`f` whose raw version is pseudoconvex to be the objective function.

2. Define the feasible point :math:`p` as :math:`\nabla f(\mathbf{0})`.

3. Define the first constraint function :math:`g_1(x)` by setting its gradient to :math:`a_1 = -p`.

4. Generate the other constraints randomly using a normal distribution while making sure that :math:`p` remains feasible for each one.

The point :math:`p=\nabla f(\mathbf{0})` defined in Step 2 is used in the definition of the first linear constraint in Step 3 and also to guarantee that the feasible set has more feasible solutions than just the origin in Step 4 (see Subsection :ref:`subsec-how-cons-are-built`). By setting the Lagrange multipliers :math:`\mu_1 = 1` and :math:`\mu_i = 0` for :math:`i=2,\ldots,l`, we have that all the KKT conditions are satisfied at the origin, which makes it a KKT point. :numref:`fig-construction-cons-fun` shows an example of construction of a constrained function with two plots. The plot on the left shows the Steps 1-3 while the one on the right shows the constrained function built from the 4 steps above. The hashed lines form the boundary of the feasible set :math:`\cal X` in each plot. Note that the point :math:`p` remains feasible after the addition of other linear constraintes in the figure on the right.

.. _fig-construction-cons-fun:

   :scale: 70
   :align: center

   Example of construction of a constrained function. Steps 1-3 are illustrated on the left while the resulting constrained function after the Step 4 is shown on the right.

Seven out of the eight objective functions composing the constrained functions in ``bbob-constrained`` are convex or pseudoconvex without considering the nonlinear transformations, which together with the fact that every linear constraint is also quasiconvex implies that a KKT point is also a global optimal solution to these constrained functions. The exception is the Rastrigin function, which is handled differently and detailed below.

If the ``bbob`` function, chosen in Step 1, includes nonlinear transformations, the algorithm above cannot ensure that the origin is the optimal solution due to the lack of pseudoconvexity of the objective function, which was used to guarantee the sufficiency of the KKT conditions for optimality. To solve this issue, we add a new step between Step 1 and Step 2 where we remove the nonlinear transformations applied to the search space in the ``bbob`` function. The nonlinear transformations are applied to the whole constrained function (:math:`f` and :math:`g_i`) only after the constraints have been built and the origin has been defined as the optimal solution. As we show in Subsection :ref:`subsec-applying-nonlinear-transformations`, the application of the Coco_ nonlinear transformations to a constrained function whose optimal solution is at the origin does not change its optimal solution. 

The final generic algorithm for defining the constrained functions is given below. As it can be seen, we also added a new step to move the optimal solution away from the origin in the end.

1. Pick up a ``bbob`` function :math:`f` whose raw version is pseudoconvex to be the objective function.

2. Remove possible nonlinear transformations from :math:`f`.

3. Define the feasible direction :math:`p` as :math:`\nabla f(\mathbf{0})`.

4. Define the first constraint function :math:`g_1(x)` by setting its gradient to :math:`a_1 = -p`.

5. Generate the other constraints randomly using a normal distribution while making sure that :math:`p` remains feasible for each one.

6. Apply to the whole constrained function (objective function + constraints) the nonlinear transformations that were removed from the objective function in Step 2.

7. Choose a random point :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}}` and move the optimal solution away from the origin by translating the constrained function (objective function + constraints) by :math:`-x^{\textrm{opt}}`.

:numref:`fig-construction-cons-fun-final` depicts a constrained function resulting from Steps 1-7. Notice that the optimal solution is no longer at the origin due to the translation by :math:`-x^{\textrm{opt}}` in Step 7.

   Example of a constrained function resulting from Steps 1-7. 

**Defining the constrained Rastrigin function**

The process described before works for all the constrained functions in the current test suite except the one involving the Rastrigin function as it is a multimodal function. Its definition is given below.

.. math::
   :label: rastrigin
   :nowrap:

   \begin{eqnarray*}
   \begin{array}{rc}
                          & f(x) = 10\bigg(n - \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\cos(2\pi z_i) \bigg) + \|z\|^2 + f_{\textrm{uopt}} \\
      \textrm{subject to} & g_i(v) \leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, l,\\
   \end{array}
   \end{eqnarray*}

where :math:`v = T_{\textrm{asy}}^{0.2}(T_{\textrm{osz}}(x - x^{\textrm{opt}}))` and :math:`z = v-x^{\textrm{uopt}}`. Without the nonlinear transformations and the translation by :math:`-x^{\textrm{opt}}`, it becomes

.. math::
   :label: rastrigin2
   :nowrap:

   \begin{eqnarray*}
   \begin{array}{rcl}
                         & f(x) = 10\bigg(n - \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\cos\Big(2\pi (x_i-x^{\textrm{uopt}}_i)\Big) \bigg) + \|x-x^{\textrm{uopt}}\|^2 + f_{\textrm{uopt}} \\
          \textrm{subject to} & g_i(x) \leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, l.\\
   \end{array}
   \end{eqnarray*}

Differently from the other constrained functions, :eq:`rastrigin2` does not have a pseudoconvex objective function. Therefore, we define the optimal solution in this case in a different manner. We first set the constant vector :math:`x^{\textrm{uopt}}=(-1,\ldots,-1)^T`. We then obtain a Rastrigin function whose unconstrained global optimal solution is at :math:`x^{\textrm{uopt}}=(-1,\ldots,-1)^T`. By defintion, such a function contains many local optimal solution which are (approximately) located on the :math:`n`-dimensional integer lattice :math:`\mathbb{Z}^n` translated by :math:`-x^{\textrm{uopt}}`.

Due to the translation of the objective function by :math:`-x^{\textrm{uopt}}`, the origin is no longer the unconstrained global optimal solution, but an unconstrained local optimal solution. In order to make it the constrained global optimal solution, we add a linear constraint function :math:`g_1(x) = a_1^T x` whose gradient is given by :math:`a_1 = x^{\textrm{uopt}}`. :numref:`fig-cons-rastrigin` shows a 2-dimensional example of the resulting function. As it can be seen, all the constrained local optimal solutions in the integer lattice, situated in the upper right part of the graph, have function values larger than the origin's due to the fact that they are farther with respect to the unconstrained global optimal solution, :math:`x^{\textrm{uopt}}=(-1,\ldots,-1)^T`, which increases the value of the term :math:`\|x-x^{\textrm{uopt}}\|^2` in the function and thus the function value itself.

.. _fig-cons-rastrigin:

.. figure:: _figs/cons_rastrigin_func_construction.png
   :scale: 80
   :align: center

   Constrained Rastrigin function in :eq:`rastrigin2` with one single linear constraint :math:`g_1(x) = a_1^T x \leq 0`, where :math:`a_1=x_{\textrm{uopt}}=(-1,\ldots,-1)^T`.

Next, all the other linear constraints are randomly generated while care is taken to keep the point :math:`p=-a_1=(1,\ldots,1)^T` feasible in order to guarantee at least a feasible half-line defined by :math:`\{\alpha p\,|\,\alpha\geq0\}`. We then apply the nonlinear transformations :math:`T_{\textrm{osz}}` and :math:`T_{\textrm{asy}}^{0.2}` to the constrained function to make it less regular. Finally, we choose a random vector :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}}` to be the optimal solution and translate the constrained function by :math:`-x^{\textrm{opt}}`.

.. _subsec-applying-nonlinear-transformations:

Applying nonlinear transformations
----------------------------------

As we mentioned in the previous subsection, we initially do not consider the nonlinear transformations in the building process of the constrained functions. Those transformations are applied after defining the origin as the optimal solution. The application of nonlinear transformations to the constrained functions, however, does not affect the location of the optimal solution already defined as we show next.

Without loss of generality, consider the minimization of a constrained function with one single linear constraint:

.. math:: 
   :nowrap:
   :label: cons_prob_trans1

   \begin{eqnarray*}
   \begin{array}{rc}
   \displaystyle\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} & f(x) \\
          \textrm{s.t.:} & g(x) = a^T x \leq 0. \\
   \end{array}
   \end{eqnarray*}

Let :math:`t:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n` be a bijective transformation function.  By "applying" :math:`t` to :eq:`cons_prob_trans1`, we obtain

.. math:: 
   :nowrap:
   :label: cons_prob_trans2

   \begin{eqnarray*}
   \begin{array}{rc}
   \displaystyle\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} & f(t(x)) \\
          \textrm{s.t.:} & g(t(x)) = a^T t(x) \leq 0. \\
   \end{array}
   \end{eqnarray*}


Assume that :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}}` is an optimal solution to :eq:`cons_prob_trans1`. Since :math:`t` is bijective, it has an inverse :math:`t^{-1}`. It follows that :math:`t^{-1}(x^{\textrm{opt}})` is an optimal solution to :eq:`cons_prob_trans2`.

**Proof:** Suppose, by contradiction, that :math:`t^{-1}(x^{\textrm{opt}})` is not an optimal solution to :eq:`cons_prob_trans2`. Then there exists a point :math:`u` such that

   g(t(u)) = a^T t(u) \leq 0\quad  \textrm{ and } \quad f(t(u)) < f(t(t^{-1}(x^{\textrm{opt}}))) = f(x^{\textrm{opt}})

Let :math:`z = t(u)`. Then, :math:`t^{-1}(z) = u`. By :eq:`nonlin_trans_proof` and the property of inverse functions, we have that

.. math:: 

   a^T z \leq 0\quad \textrm{ and } \quad f(z) = f(t(t^{-1}(z)) = f(t(u)) < f(x^{\textrm{opt}}).  

This contradicts the assumption of :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}}` being a global minimum to problem :eq:`cons_prob_trans1`. **Q.E.D.**


Since the transformations :math:`T_{\textrm{asy}}^{\beta}` and :math:`T_{\textrm{osz}}` in Coco_ are strictly increasing functions, they are both injective. Besides, they are neither bounded above nor below, which, together with the fact that they are continuous, implies that they are surjective. Therefore, :math:`T_{\textrm{asy}}^{\beta}` and :math:`T_{\textrm{osz}}` are bijective, thus having inverse functions. Since the optimal solution :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}}` to :eq:`cons_prob_trans1` is initially defined as the origin in the construction of the constrained functions, the proof given above implies that :math:`t^{-1}(x^{\textrm{opt}}) = t^{-1}(\mathbf{0})` is an optimal solution to :eq:`cons_prob_trans2`. Besides that, by definition of :math:`T_{\textrm{asy}}^{\beta}` and :math:`T_{\textrm{osz}}`, we have that :math:`t(\mathbf{0})=\mathbf{0}` for any of these two transformations. Using this together with the fact that :math:`t(t^{-1}(\mathbf{0}))=\mathbf{0}` (by the property of inverse functions) and by the injectivity of :math:`t`, we must have :math:`t^{-1}(\mathbf{0})=\mathbf{0}`. This implies that the origin is still the optimal solution after any of these two nonlinear transformations have been applied to the constrained function.


.. _sec-test-constrained-functions:

The ``bbob-constrained`` constrained functions and their properties
===================================================================

We now detail the 48 ``bbob-constrained`` constrained functions and the common properties of the objective functions composing them.

In total, there are 8 different objective functions, and each one is tested with 6 different numbers of constraints: :math:`1`, :math:`2`, :math:`6`, :math:`6+\lfloor n/2\rfloor`, :math:`6 + n` and :math:`6 + 3n`. The first objective function in the suite is given by the sphere function. The first constrained function, :math:`f_1`, is thus defined by the sphere function subject to 1 constraint. The second constrained function, :math:`f_2`, is defined by the sphere function subject to 2 constraints. The third constrained function, :math:`f_3`, is defined by the sphere function subject to 6 constraints, and so on. The 7th constrained function, :math:`f_7`, is then defined by the ellipsoidal function (the second objective function) subject to 1 constraint, and the same process repeats. The 48 constrained problems are summarized in the table below, where the inner cell IDs refer to the ``bbob-constrained`` problems, the outer row and column respectively denote the numbers of constraints and the single-objective ``bbob`` functions.

The number of constraints, :math:`l`, in a constrained function :math:`f_i` can be obtained via the index formula :math:`I=((i-1) \bmod 6) + 1`. The index :math:`I` can then be used to index into the list of all possible number of constraints :math:`N = (1, 2, 6, 6+\lfloor n/2 \rfloor, 6+n, 6+3n)` to get the final number as :math:`l=N(I)`. Take, for instance, the constrained function :math:`f_{11}` which is the ellipsoid function subject to :math:`6+n` constraints. We first compute the corresponding index as :math:`((11-1) \bmod 6) + 1 = (10 \bmod 6 ) + 1 = 5` which then can be used to look up the number of constraints as :math:`N(5)=6+n`.

We separate the 48 constrained functions into groups with respect to their objective function, thereby having 8 groups. Each group contains 6 different constrained functions as each objective function is tested with 6 different numbers of constraints. We list the groups below with some properties of the objective functions that define them. As described in Subsection :ref:`subsec-defining-the-constrained-functions`, by translating the objective function and the constraints with the use of the randomly-generated point :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}}`, we define :math:`x^{\textrm{opt}}` as the optimal solution. Furthermore, the unconstrained optimal solution moves from :math:`x^{\textrm{uopt}}` to :math:`x^{\textrm{uopt}}+x^{\textrm{opt}}`.
