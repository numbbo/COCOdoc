The documentation of the COCO platform is split into several parts:

### Documentation of the COCO source code and its functioning: coco-documentation
The COCO source code itself is documented directly within itself in the code-experiments/ folders
of the numbbo/coco repository and then transformed via doxygen into html and published at
numbbo.github.io/coco-documentation via this repository. More details about how to deal with this 
part can be found below.

### Documentation of generic Coco setting
The generic parts of Coco are documented in two separate documents:
* coco-generic/experimental-setup for the description of the experimental setup (source in
  ../docs/coco-generic/experimental-setup/source and then published via Sphinx to
  https://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/experimental-setup)
* coco-generic/perf-assessment for the description of the performance assessment, plots, etc. (source in
  ../docs/coco-generic/perf-assessment/source and then published via Sphinx to
  https://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/perf-assessment)

### Documentation of the test suites
Each test suite will have separate documentations for the function documentation and (potentially) the experimental setting.
For the moment, we have the following documentations:
* bbob-biobj/perf-assessment (source in ../docs/bbob-biobj/perf-assessment/source and then published via Sphinx to 
  https://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/bbob-biobj/perf-assessment)
* bbob-biobj/functions (source in ../docs/bbob-biobj/functions/source and then published via Sphinx to 
  https://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/bbob-biobj/functions)
* bbob-largescale/functions (source in ../docs/bbob-largescale/functions/source and then published via Sphinx to 
  https://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/bbob-largescale/functions)
* bbob-constrained/functions (source in ../docs/bbob-constrained/functions/source and then published via Sphinx to 
  https://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/bbob-constrained/functions)
* bbob-experiments (old documentation available at http://coco.lri.fr/downloads/download15.03/bbobdocfunctions.pdf)
* bbob-functions (old documentation available at http://coco.lri.fr/downloads/download15.03/bbobdocexperiment.pdf)
* bbob-noisy-functions (old documentation available at http://coco.lri.fr/downloads/download15.03/bbobdocnoisyfunctions.pdf)

### Documentations related to the workshops
Web pages for the workshops are also created from reStructuredText via Sphinx. The source files can be found in the 
nummbo/workshops repository.



HowTo: Edit and Publish the experimental setting and function documentations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The source files (as reStructuredText) can be found and edited in the subfolders of docs/. Their reStructuredText is
translated into html, latex, or pdf with the help of Sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org). To build the html, latex, or pdf
output for each documentation, you need to install sphinx by typing `pip install -U Sphinx` (if you have installed pip) and then
type `make html`, `make latex`, or `make latexpdf` in the corresponding subfolder of docs/.

For publishing the html to the web, a `make html-topublish` in the corresponding subfolder will create the
same html files than `make html` but instead of the build/ subfolder, it uses the correct folder to be published
directly on the webpage. To make this actually happen, the changes made have to be pushed to the only branch called
`gh-pages` by a simple `git push` command. Due to the git pages functionality, this push will directly update the web page.

#### Summary:
- need: python, sphinx, git
- edit `.rst` sources in docs/FOLDERNAME and commit and push as usual within the only existing branch `gh-pages`
- for checking the output, type `make html`, `make latex`, or `make latexpdf` (output written to build/ subfolder)
- for publishing the changes to the web:
  - create the html with `make html-topublish`
  - commit and push the changes (in the `gh-pages` branch) to update the web page

#### Current documentations and their repositories:
- sources in ../docs/bbob-biobj/functions are written into bbob-biobj/functions folder
- sources in ../docs/bbob-biobj/perf-assessment are written into bbob-biobj/perf-assessment folder
- sources in ../docs/bbob-largescale/functions are written into bbob-largescale/functions folder
- sources in ../docs/bbob-constrained/functions are written into bbob-constrained/functions folder
- sources in ../docs/coco-doc are written directly into the root of the coco-doc repository
  [see also below, because this documentation is partly build from the source code]


HowTo: Edit and Publish the COCO documentation
----------------------------------------------
In addition to the reStructuredText which explains the general functioning of the COCO platform in
../docs/coco-doc/ (which is translated into html via Sphinx as described above), parts of the COCO 
documentation are automatically extracted from the source code.

The C code in the code-experiments/src/ folder of the numbbo/coco repository for example is translated into html
in the C/ subfolder of this `gh-pages` branch of the numbbo/coco-doc repository with the help of the doxygen tool
(www.doxygen.org/). After installing doxygen, and having a clone of the `master` or `development` branch of the
numbbo/coco github repository in the same folder than your numbbo/coco-doc checkout, you can create the html output
in this directory by simply typing `doxygen` in the docs/coco-doc/C/ folder. Afterwards, commit and push
of this repository will again update the web page directly as described above. Note that we have tried a few versions of doxygen back in January 2020 and not all were producing the output we wanted. Hence, we suggest to use Doxygen version 1.8.11.

To create and publish the documentation of the cocoex and cocopp modules as well as the example_experiment.py,
use pydoctor and copy the resulting files to the coco GForge repository at 
`/home/groups/coco/htdocs/apidocs-cocoex/`, 
`/home/groups/coco/htdocs/apidocs-cocopp/`, and 
`/home/groups/coco/htdocs/apidocs-example_experiment/`
respectively. For the `cocopp` module:
```
cd code-postprocessing
conda activate py27  # was: source activate py27
# pip install pydoctor    # needed to create the docs
# conda install docutils  # needed to parse restructed text
pydoctor --docformat=restructuredtext --make-html cocopp
source deactivate
rsync -auv apidocs/ scm.gforge.inria.fr:/home/groups/coco/htdocs/apidocs-cocopp
```
For the `cocoex` module, you have to copy/rename the
`code-experiments/build/python/python/` folder to `cocoex`:

```
cd code-experiments/build/python
cp -rp python cocoex  # precondition: make sure cocoex does not exist
conda activate py27  # was: source activate py27
pydoctor --docformat=restructuredtext --make-html cocoex
pydoctor --docformat=restructuredtext --make-html example_experiment2.py
source deactivate
rsync -auv apidocs/ scm.gforge.inria.fr:/home/groups/coco/htdocs/apidocs-cocoex
rsync -auv apidocs/example_experiment2.html scm.gforge.inria.fr:/home/groups/coco/htdocs/apidocs-example_experiment
```
which also creates the `example_experiment2.py` documentation.
